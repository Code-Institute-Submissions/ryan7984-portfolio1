## Design 

Colour Scheme 

Due to the nature of the website green is a predominant color 
so I decided to use a pallet of colours which would complement green.
I used a brighter stand out color to draw attention to the contact button and white colored text where needed to make the text easier to read. I toned down the background color of the body from white to make the pages easier on the eye. I feel the color of the header and footer provide nice contrast to the rest of the color scheme. 

* #3A3A3A - Dark shade of gray
* #FFD200 - Light yellow shade
* #1A2D40 - Dark shade of cyan-blue
* #CCCCCC - Chinese silver/light shade of gray 
* #04AA6D - Green-cyan

## Typography

After trying different fonts I felt the the font which is is used in the love running project looked best on the website. I like these fonts the most as they look modern and are not too formal but still look professional. 

The google fonts used are: 

* Body font family: Lato, sans-serif
* h1 h2 font family: Oswald, sans-serif

## Imagery 

All imagery used are free to use images without copyright from a website called pixabay. 

---

## Media

I made sure to use a video where the user provided the embed code to be shared. The video is from youtube.

## Features

The website is comprised of 3 pages, all of which are accessible from the navigation menu: home page, contact page and gallery page.

* All pages on the website have:

1. A navigation menu on the top right hand side which allows the user to  
   navigate through the site. 
   The full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home Page, Gallery Page and Contact Page allowing the user top navigate easily throughout the different pages and without the need for the back button.  
   The logo is on the top left hand corner and the logo when pressed provides a link to the Home Page. 
   
   Each link in the navigation bar remains underlined when the user is on that page making it easier for the user to track where they are on the website 

   The header is fixed so that it is always available as the user scrolls down through the page.

2. A simple footer which just includes the important social links. I used the 
   same social links as the love running project for facebook, instagram , twitter and youtube. I also added a logo and link to inkedin. 

3. A main hero image with a stand out contact button which brings the user 
   straight to the contact section of the website on the contact page.
