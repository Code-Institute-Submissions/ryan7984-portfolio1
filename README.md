## Design 

Colour Scheme 

Due to the nature of the website green is a predominat color 
so I decided to use a pallet of colours which would complement green.
I used a brighter stand out color to draw attaention to the contact button and white colored text where needed to make the text easier to read. I toned down the background color of the body from white to make the pages easier on the eye. I feel the color of the header and footer provide nice conttrast to the rest of the color scheme. 

* #3A3A3A
* #FFD200
* #1A2D40
* #CCCCCC
* #04AA6D
